# demo_sqflite

This app provides basic functionality for adding, deleting, and displaying notes locally on the device.

## Getting Started

1). A NoteListScreen widget that displays a list of notes and provides options to add and delete notes.
2). The Database object is initialized using SQLite to store notes locally.
3). Users can add notes using the text field at the bottom of the screen.
4). Notes are displayed in a ListView.builder widget, allowing users to see all existing notes.
5). Each note has a delete button (IconButton) that allows users to delete a note.
6). When the app starts, it initializes the database and retrieves existing notes from the database.
